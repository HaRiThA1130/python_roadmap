# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

This repository contains my structured learning progress in Python programming. It includes basic concepts, examples, and practice programs as I learn Python step-by-step.

---

# 📌 Day 1 – Python Basics

---

## ✅ 1. Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, beginner-friendly programming language.  
It is widely used in:

- Web Development
- Artificial Intelligence
- Data Science
- Automation
- Software Development
- Cyber Security

Python is easy to read and write because its syntax is similar to English.

---

## ✅ 2. Hello World Program

The first program in any programming language is usually the Hello World program. It is used to understand how output works.

### Example:
```python
print("Hello World")
```

### Explanation:
- `print()` is a built-in function used to display output.
- Text must be written inside quotes.

---

## ✅ 3. Variables

Variables are used to store data values in a program.

### Example:
```python
name = "Haritha"
age = 21
percentage = 92.5
is_student = True
```

---

### 📌 Data Types Learned

#### 🔹 String
- Stores text data
```python
name = "Python"
```

#### 🔹 Integer
- Stores whole numbers
```python
age = 21
```

#### 🔹 Float
- Stores decimal numbers
```python
marks = 92.5
```

#### 🔹 Boolean
- Stores True or False values
```python
is_passed = True
```

---

## ✅ 4. User Input

Input allows users to enter values during program execution.

### Example:
```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(name)
```

### Important Note:
- `input()` always stores data as string.

---

## ✅ 5. Type Conversion

Type conversion is used to change one data type into another.

### Methods:

#### Convert to Integer
```python
age = int(input("Enter age: "))
```

#### Convert to Float
```python
price = float(input("Enter price: "))
```

#### Convert to String
```python
num = str(10)
```

---

## ✅ 6. Conditional Statements

Conditional statements are used for decision making in programs.

---

### 🔹 If Statement
```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("Eligible")
```

---

### 🔹 If-Else Statement
```python
if age >= 18:
    print("Eligible")
else:
    print("Not Eligible")
```

---

### 🔹 If-Elif-Else Statement
```python
marks = 85

if marks >= 90:
    print("A Grade")
elif marks >= 70:
    print("B Grade")
else:
    print("C Grade")
```

---

## ✅ 7. While Loop

A while loop is used to repeat a block of code while a condition is true.

---

### 🔹 Loop Structure
1. Initialization
2. Condition
3. Updation

---

### Example:
```python
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

---

### Output:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

---

### Explanation:
- `i = 1` → Starting value
- `while i <= 5` → Condition
- `i += 1` → Increases value each time

---

## ✅ 8. Important Concepts Learned

- Python syntax basics
- Proper indentation in Python
- Use of colon `:` in loops and conditions
- Avoiding infinite loops
- Understanding execution flow of programs

---
