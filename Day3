# Python Learning Notes – Day 3

Today I learned about **nested loops** and how loops can be used to create **patterns** in Python. This helped me understand how programs can control rows and columns while printing output.

# Understanding Nested Loops

A nested loop means a **loop inside another loop**.

In simple words:
- One loop controls the **rows**
- Another loop controls the **columns**

This is mainly used when printing patterns or working with tables.

Basic structure:

```python
for i in range(rows):
    for j in range(columns):
        print("*", end=" ")
```

Here:
- The outer loop runs first.
- For every iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs completely.

This means the inner loop runs multiple times for each row.

# How Nested Loops Actually Work

Example:

```python
for i in range(1, 4):
    for j in range(1, 4):
        print("*", end=" ")
    print()
```

Explanation:

Outer loop:
```
i = 1
i = 2
i = 3
```

Inner loop:
Runs fully for each value of `i`.

Execution flow:

When i = 1  
j runs from 1 to 3  
Output:
```
* * *
```

When i = 2  
j runs again from 1 to 3  
Output:
```
* * *
```

When i = 3  
j runs again from 1 to 3  
Output:
```
* * *
```

Final Output:
```
* * *
* * *
* * *
```

This helped me understand how rows and columns are printed.

# Pattern Printing

Pattern programs use loops to print shapes like triangles, squares, and pyramids.

These programs help improve logical thinking.

---

# Pattern 1 – Square Pattern

Program:

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    for j in range(1, 6):
        print("*", end=" ")
    print()
```

Output:

```
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
```

Explanation:

Outer loop → controls number of rows  
Inner loop → controls number of stars in each row

Since both loops run 5 times, it prints a 5×5 square.

---

# Pattern 2 – Right Triangle Pattern

Program:

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    for j in range(1, i + 1):
        print("*", end=" ")
    print()
```

Output:

```
*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *
```

Explanation:

Here the inner loop depends on the outer loop.

Row 1 → print 1 star  
Row 2 → print 2 stars  
Row 3 → print 3 stars  
Row 4 → print 4 stars  
Row 5 → print 5 stars

So the pattern increases step by step.

---

# Pattern 3 – Number Pattern

Program:

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    for j in range(1, i + 1):
        print(j, end=" ")
    print()
```

Output:

```
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5
```

Explanation:

Instead of printing stars, we print numbers.

Each row prints numbers starting from 1 up to the row number.

# Important Concept I Learned Today

One important thing I learned today is the use of this:

```
end=" "
```

Normally, `print()` moves to the next line automatically.

But when we use:

```python
print("*", end=" ")
```

Python prints on the same line.

This is very important for pattern programs.

And this line:

```python
print()
```

moves the output to the next row.

# What I Understood from Today’s Learning

Today’s learning helped me understand how loops can be combined to control complex outputs. At first nested loops looked confusing, but after observing how the outer loop and inner loop work together, it became clearer.

I realized that:
- The outer loop controls rows.
- The inner loop controls what is printed in each row.
- Patterns are created by changing the range of loops.
- The `end` parameter helps control the format of output.

Pattern programs improved my logical thinking because I had to understand how the number of prints changes in each row.

Overall, today I understood how nested loops work and how they are used to build structured outputs like patterns.
