# Python Learning Notes – What I Learned Today

Today I continued learning Python and focused mainly on understanding **for loops**, the **range() function**, and writing a program to generate a **multiplication table**. I tried to understand not just the code, but also how the program actually runs step by step.

## Understanding the For Loop

A for loop in Python is used when we want to repeat something multiple times. Instead of writing the same line again and again, we can use a loop to run it automatically.

Before learning loops, I realized that if I wanted to print numbers from 1 to 10 manually, I would have to write:

```python
print(1)
print(2)
print(3)
print(4)
print(5)
```

This would take more time and is not efficient, especially when the numbers become larger. That is where the **for loop** becomes useful.

The basic structure of a for loop is:

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```

Here is how I understood it:

- `for` means we are starting a loop.
- `i` is a variable that changes every time the loop runs.
- `range(1, 6)` tells Python which numbers to use.
- The loop starts from **1** and goes until **5** (because the ending value is not included).
- `print(i)` prints the value each time the loop runs.

So the loop runs like this internally:

First run → i = 1  
Second run → i = 2  
Third run → i = 3  
Fourth run → i = 4  
Fifth run → i = 5  

After that, the loop stops.

Output becomes:

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

This helped me understand how Python repeats tasks automatically.

## Understanding the Range Function

The `range()` function is very important when using loops. It basically generates numbers for the loop to use.

I learned that range can work in different ways.

### 1. Range with start and end

```python
range(1, 11)
```

This generates numbers from **1 to 10**.

So the loop will run 10 times.

---

### 2. Range with only one number

```python
range(5)
```

This starts from **0** and goes up to **4**.

Output will be:

```
0
1
2
3
4
```

I understood that Python starts counting from **0** by default.

---

### 3. Range with step value

```python
range(1, 11, 2)
```

This means the numbers increase by 2 each time.

Output:

```
1
3
5
7
9
```

This helped me understand how loops can skip numbers or move faster through a sequence.

## Multiplication Table Program

One of the main programs I learned today was generating a multiplication table using a loop.

The code is:

```python
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

for i in range(1, 11):
    result = number * i
    print(number, "x", i, "=", result)
```

At first, I carefully understood each line.

---

### Step 1: Taking Input from the User

```python
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
```

Here, the program asks the user to enter a number.

Example:

```
Enter a number: 5
```

The input is normally a string, but we used `int()` to convert it into a number.  
Now the variable `number` stores the value **5**.

---

### Step 2: Starting the Loop

```python
for i in range(1, 11):
```

This line means the loop will run from **1 to 10**.

Each time the loop runs, the value of `i` changes.

So the loop runs like this:

```
i = 1
i = 2
i = 3
i = 4
i = 5
i = 6
i = 7
i = 8
i = 9
i = 10
```

This means the loop runs **10 times**.

---

### Step 3: Performing the Calculation

```python
result = number * i
```

Here the number entered by the user is multiplied by the loop value.

If the user entered **5**, the program calculates:

```
5 × 1
5 × 2
5 × 3
5 × 4
5 × 5
...
```

Each result is stored in the variable `result`.

---

### Step 4: Printing the Result

```python
print(number, "x", i, "=", result)
```

This line prints the multiplication table in a proper format.

The output becomes:

```
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
5 x 4 = 20
5 x 5 = 25
5 x 6 = 30
5 x 7 = 35
5 x 8 = 40
5 x 9 = 45
5 x 10 = 50
```

This helped me understand how loops and calculations work together.

## What I Actually Understood from Today’s Learning

From today’s learning, I clearly understood how Python executes loops step by step. Earlier, I thought loops were complicated, but after practicing, I realized they simply repeat instructions in a controlled way.

I also understood that:
- Loops help reduce code repetition.
- The `range()` function controls how many times the loop runs.
- A loop variable changes automatically.
- We can combine loops with calculations to build useful programs.
- Python syntax is simple but indentation is very important.

Writing the multiplication table program helped me see how real programs are built using small concepts like input, loops, and calculations.

Overall, today’s learning improved my understanding of how Python programs actually run behind the scenes.
